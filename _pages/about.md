Hello, My name is Jay Choi. My areas of interest are:


- Machine learning, Natural Language Processing


As there's enough resources covering basic concepts online, I want to focus on the material I'm confused a lot in studying machine learning and natural language processing. I'm posting in English or Korean. I hope to study and grow together.

You can check my [cv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%EC%A0%95%EC%9C%A4-%EC%B5%9C-3b394a116/) here.
